# Bus Booking System

## Overview
The Bus Booking System is a console-based application developed as a mini-project to manage bus bookings. This project is implemented using Java and provides functionality for booking bus tickets, checking availability, and displaying bus information. The application allows users to book tickets on different buses and handles basic validation for booking dates and capacities.

## Features
- **Bus Management:** Create and display bus details including bus number, AC status, and capacity.
- **Booking System:** Book tickets by entering passenger details and bus number.
- **Availability Check:** Ensure that the selected bus has available seats for the chosen date.
- **User Interaction:** Simple console-based interface for user interaction.

## Technologies Used
- **Programming Language:** Java
- **Data Structures:** ArrayList
- **Date Handling:** SimpleDateFormat for date validation

## Installation and Setup
